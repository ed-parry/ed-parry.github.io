We're hopefully moving home early next year so we're in the spring clean, de-clutter phase a little earlier than normal. This time I'm also trying to tackle everything digital.

Digital storage has for so long been cheap that deleting files almost feels unnecessary. But now I look back I see thousands of pointless files. Documents from school days, inconsequential contracts that ended a decade ago, photos of where I parked my car in airport carparks to remind me upon return. Just because I can keep all of this, really doesn't mean that I should. 

I'm probably a bit of a digital hoarder. The question, "but what if?" plagues me as I go through things. With storage remaining cheap I'm being relatively lenient with what stays, but it still feels good to clear everything down and re-organise.
