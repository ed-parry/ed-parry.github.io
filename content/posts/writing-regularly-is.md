Writing regularly is hard. 

It's not for a lack of ideas but spending so much time online you start to think, "isn't there enough content already?"

I hate that word. Content. The internet has this ability to take the most incredible work from the worlds most impressive artists, authors, designers, journalists and distill it down and categorise it to its most basic form. Just. More. Content.

I came across Henrik Karlsson and his blog, [Escaping Flatland](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/) yesterday. It is beautifully written and it's clear the amount of work put into his pieces. 

He has this concept of a waste book. A second, more private, blog that is much more a stream of consciousness than an edited and refined collection. 

That's what this is. My waste book. I'm mostly just thinking out loud here, figuring out what is important to me. The fact that it is shared online and is public is nothing more than a sense of accountability. It's not just a notebook page I'll never look at again, it's out there, somewhere, with my name against it.
