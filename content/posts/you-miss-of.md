This resonates with me a lot at the moment. Working in Product I'm surrounded by smart people and ideas. I have a long list of incredibly brilliant product and business ideas that - if only I had the time - would surely be runaway successes. _Surely_.

But the problem is - I almost certainly do have the time. If I was genuine with myself and set this as my priority, I could easily find the hours needed.

It's the same with writing. I enjoy it and want to improve. But that improvement takes time. And crucially it takes time being poor at it before it gets any better. 

I have to be in the room. I have to take the shot. I have to learn to be comfortable with missing and most importantly take another shot. 

Maybe a component of this blog can be some amount of accountability. Not having Twitter means there's not really anywhere to advertise this writing, and I haven't bothered with any analytics because that's not really the point. But it's still public, it can still be found, and so there's a record here that I'd like to look back on and be proud of. Otherwise my missed shot count remains at 100%.
