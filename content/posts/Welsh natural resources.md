quote = 'Wales stands at a critical moment as our economy continues to degrade the natural resources that underpin our health, security, and prosperity. Wales is one of the most nature depleted countries in the world, with almost 1 out of 5 species at risk of extinction.

Wales’ consumption levels far exceed sustainable limits. If replicated globally, our resource use would require more than two Earths, demonstrating the amount of natural resources we import, all accompanied by impacts on other countries'

The [State of Natural Resource Report 2025](https://cdn.cyfoethnaturiol.cymru/f45ehjei/sonarr2025-final-report.pdf) paints a very bleak picture. All too often we look elsewhere, at what other countries are doing or the United Kingdom as a whole. But here in Wales we're at a critical point. Our history, particularly agriculture which accounts for 90% of Welsh land, isn't easily compatible with achieving climate goals. Recent changes to legislation, including the Sustainable Farming Scheme has real potential, though it's still not perfect and is still struggling to balance the agricultural industry and people with the broader needs of our country. 

Reading this report is making me really think about my own impact. We've all got to do more to protect nature. I need to find out what that is, though. There's a lot to think about here.
