> Social networks became “social media,” which, at first, meant receiving content from people you chose to hear from. But in the quest to maximize engagement, the timeline of friends and people you picked to follow turned into a free-for-all battle for attention. And it turns out, for most people, your friends aren’t as entertaining as (god forbid) influencers who spend their waking hours making “content.”

This is an [exciting post from Ev Williams](https://ev.medium.com/making-social-social-again-0126fa5c6ce8) as he launches a new social network app, [Mozi](https://www.mozi.app/).

No social _media_, just networking. Seeing who is where and fostering that connection. It's well worth reading the post and checking out the app. It's a great concept and something in general I think many people are longing for. 

There's far too much content consumption for all of us. Every time I leave the house my first thought is "what shall I listen to whilst walking/driving". I immediately search for something to fill the silence. But all that does is reduce the time I have to think. Explore ideas. Form better ideas. Refine ideas.

This has been a driving force of my writing here. Just get something down on the page without worrying too much. We can improve as we go. It just gives me a space to think. After all, that's really what writing is.
