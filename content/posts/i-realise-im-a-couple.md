I realise I’m a couple of weeks late to the party with this, but the onboarding user experience with [poke.com](https://poke.com) is brilliant. 

It immediately feels familiar, being positioned as a contact through an existing chat interface, and it feels as though it “knows” you within a few minutes. Negotiating a monthly price is also novel, though I expect the vast majority of users end up paying the same amount. 

However, I've played and enjoyed it for about a week and the novelty is starting to wear off. Sure, it's immediately accessible and has helped draft a few emails, but in each case I've felt the need to adjust the draft before sending. Scheduled reminders and daily briefings are nice, but I've struggled to fit them into any sort of routine. 

This is very much the state of AI more broadly today. Novel, intriguing, powerful. But we're still figuring out how to integrate it properly. The real power is still to come. We’re still in the dial-up era.
