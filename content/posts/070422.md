My favourite part of my watch is the part you almost never get to see. The hidden workings. The intricate details. 

Objectively this isn't a very good watch. After a couple of days it's often a few minutes behind. But that doesn't matter to me. It's still by far my favourite possession. A gift from my wife. I love wearing it, and I love taking it off and admiring the mechanism each day. There's something so appealing about mechanical watches. As long as it moves, it'll just keep going.
