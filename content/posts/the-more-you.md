It's the age old problem with software development. How do you maintain live systems, provide prompt support and resolutions to customers, and continue to evolve and improve? How do you incentivise teams that would naturally prefer to be building something new to actually spend time fixing something older? 

We've tried a number of different approaches but none of them have stuck as well as we'd like. For us it is a problem of quality and scale. We build too much that's new without dedicating necessary time to what's already there. We move onto the next big thing before making sure that everything is bullet proof first. Our eyes are bigger than our stomach, and that sometimes means we get sick. 

Time to go and listen, research new options, experiment with what could work.

I'll report back.
