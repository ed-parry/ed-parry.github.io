[Nick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast is one of my favourites](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04z203l).

Almost every episode I form an expectation of what I will make of the guest before it starts. Do I typically agree with their politics, expect to find myself agreeing with them, or relating to their stories?

Yet every episode I'm pleasantly surprised. The style of interview and the questions being asked go beyond the headlines and I consistently find myself appreciating the guests more than I expected. They're all much more than a party member, or policy advocate.

In politics, but also more generally, I really dislike when one element of a person sets the complete tone for an interaction. How James Anderson votes has zero bearing on his incredible talent on a cricket field. Taylor Swift coming out in support of a political candidate doesn't take anything away from the incredible show we saw this year. They're no more defined by one characteristic as by another. 

People are complex. As long as people are willing to explain, debate and where necessary change their opinions in light of new information, we should praise those that share views and stand up for things, whether we personally agree with them or not.
