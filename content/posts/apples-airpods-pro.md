[Apple’s AirPods Pro hearing health features are as good as they sound](https://www.theverge.com/24275178/apple-airpods-pro-hearing-aid-test-protection-preview)

Since I discussed [these features a few days ago](https://edparry.com/2024/09/13/airpods-as-an.html), this felt a timely update. This is great to see. Also, The Verge URL had no tracking or campaign nonsense as part of it. Beautiful.
