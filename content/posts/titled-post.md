I've been experimenting with different static site generators lately, and I'm impressed by how far they've come. The developer experience is fantastic, and the performance is unmatched.

What I particularly love is the simplicity of writing in Markdown. No database, no complex CMS interface, just plain text files. It's refreshing.

The build times are blazingly fast, and deploying to services like GitHub Pages or Netlify is trivial. Plus, version control comes naturally when your entire site is just a git repository.

I think for personal blogs and documentation sites, static generators are the perfect solution.
