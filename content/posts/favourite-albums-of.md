There's been a lot of great music this year, but these have been my standout favourites.

#### [The Greatest Love](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/the-greatest-love/1736170738), London Grammar
This is a band that have stayed true to their original sound whilst continuing to refine it. Hannah Reid's vocals take centre stage as they should. Sit back, close your eye and enjoy "You and I", then just let the album play through. Bliss. 


#### [LOOM](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/loom/1741841621), Imagine Dragons
I came to Imagine Dragons quite late, so this is the first album release I've picked up on time. This album has powered me through many workouts since this summer.


#### [Mountainhead](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/mountainhead/1710738572), Everything Everything
I first heard the distinctive sound of Jonathan Higgs' voice when they supported Foals on a UK tour in 2021. I find it best to not think too heavily about their music. If you do it often sounds like it shouldn't work, but when you just let it play it's fantastic. 


#### [Live from the Royal Albert Hall](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/dua-lipa-live-from-the-royal-albert-hall/1779948675), Dua Lipa
Elegant is the word that comes first to mind listening to this. Dua Lipa writes a great pop song and they're all here. Combine that with a beautiful orchestration and staging and you have a very enjoyable 90 minutes. 


#### [The Mighty Several](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/the-mighty-several/1751697800), Paul Heaton
This is just good old fashioned songwriting. Storytelling lyrics, classic rhythms, sharp arrangements. You can't help but enjoy this one. An album just as it should be.
