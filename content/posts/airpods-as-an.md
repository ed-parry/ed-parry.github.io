The latest updates to Apple AirPods bring a [wealth of new accessibility features](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/airpods/devec5c64a16/web) that I think we'll all be able to benefit from. 

Growing up my grandmother had hearing aids. They were huge, grey plastic devices that you'd struggle to wear with glasses. Every time you went near to them (hugging, for example), they'd ring out like some sort of panic alarm. They weren't brilliant, didn't work as well as you needed them to and were generally a pain to live with. 

Now, one of my friends has hearing aids. Except you'd never know. They're ludicrously small but much more powerful, too. And they take advantage of improved connection methods, meaning bluetooth is an option. So he's able to connect to his phone, computer, TV. Going to a gig, he can tune in to a feed from the sound desk. Everywhere he goes, he has crystal clear audio available to him. 

Hearing aids in the 1990s were beige accessibility devices. Hearing aids in the 2020s are a superpower. 

Which is why it's brilliant to see companies like Apple consider this use case in their headphones. 

As far as I'm aware, my hearing is fine. I know it's not perfect, but for my age and environment it's where it should be. I spent a lot of time wearing AirPods - at my desk on video calls, out running, in the gym, commuting. There are many occasions where hearing my environment isn't easy, but where the AirPods can happily use the microphone to listen, and then combine that environmental noise with whatever I've chosen to listen to to give me the safest balance.

Technology, and personal devices in particular, is designed to improve our lives and ability to enjoy the world around us. This is a great example of that. A little bit of consideration for how more users can benefit from AirPods (and I'm sure many other brands of similar headphones over time) that improves the experience for everyone.
