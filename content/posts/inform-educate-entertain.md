Went to see Public Service Broadcasting last night. I've been lucky enough to see some incredible live music this year, and this show was up there with the best. A small venue, but excellent sound and visuals, which is something PSB are particularly known for. 

They're pretty unique in their approach I feel. They take public service broadcast audio and use it produce original music. Choose a topic - coal mining, the space race, Amelia Earhart for the most recent album - and tell the story through a new medium. They inform, educate, and most definitely entertain.
