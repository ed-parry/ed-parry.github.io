## About This Site

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast static site generator, and hosted on GitHub Pages. The design emphasizes simplicity and readability, using serif fonts and a stream-like layout inspired by micro.blog and Twitter. Posts are written in Markdown and automatically timestamped with relative dates.
