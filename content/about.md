    <p class="about-label">INTRODUCTION</p>
    <p>I'm a product leader with over a decade of experience spanning software development, technical consultancy, and product strategy.</p><p>I started my career writing code for public sector clients, rose to lead consulting teams, and eventually found my way into product where I get to combine technical understanding with commercial thinking to build things that last.</p>
    <p>Away from the desk, I'm usually found outside either running, cycling or walking our family dog with coffee in hand. My wife and I have a young son who keeps things unpredictable, but we wouldn't have it any other way.</p>

    <p class="about-label">CURRENTLY</p>
    <p>I'm exploring how automation and AI can be applied practically within product and operations as a way to eliminate repetitive work and free up time for higher-value thinking.</p>

      <h3>Head of Product</h3>
      <p>I'm currently Head of Product at a print-on-demand platform that enables creators and brands to sell custom products globally without holding inventory. I joined in 2019 as the company's first product manager.</p><p></p><p>Since then, I've led the transition to a product-driven organisational structure, introduced cross-functional teams aligned to core product areas, and overseen the technical integration of multiple acquisitions during a period of rapid growth. I'm responsible for product strategy, ensuring our roadmap aligns with company vision and consistently delivers value for merchants building businesses on our platform.</p>

      <h3>IT Consultant</h3>
      <p>Before moving into product, I spent several years as a software consultant. I worked primarily with public sector clients building web applications and content management systems. I progressed quickly from developer to senior consultant and team lead, managing delivery across multiple concurrent projects while introducing agile practices across the company.</p><p>It was here I developed an appreciation for how software gets built well: clear scope, honest communication, and continuous improvement.</p>
